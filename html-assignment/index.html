                <p>My name is Evan Cameron, I also go by EvnEssnce online. I work as a Production Manager for Elo Hell Esports, an online broadcasting corporation responsible for the production of events such as <em>Overwatch Contenders China 2020</em> and <em>The Trial of Champions</em>. When I'm not busy obsessing over video games and productions, I love to spend my free time playing volleyball, building computers, practicing martial arts</p>
                <p>One significant thing about me that not many people know is that I only have one working lung. I was born with a <abbr title="Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia">CDH</abbr> which prevented the correct growth and development of my left lung before I was born. Due to a surgery when I was very young they were able to correct the hole in my diaphragm and ensure that I would live unaffected by the condition.</p>
