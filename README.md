This web portfolio, which I created, is an attempt to demonstrate the projects I've worked on, and some of the expertise I have in the esports broadcast industry. At first I found it quite challenging to properly display my work on a website, without embedding videos or massive amounts of data directly onto the site. I then realised that by embedding twitter, and referencing images of events I had worked, it might more easily allow people who visit my site to understand the work I do. One thing I thought about as well was linking my "liquipedia" page, which is essentially a wikipedia for esports players and talent. I decided against this only for the reason that I feel that any of that information can more easily be found in my resume, as well as many other important pieces about myself.

All in all, I'm quite happy with the final result. Though quite basic, I think the colour scheme, font and overall image really shows off some of what I can do, while still leaving some room for improvement in the future.
